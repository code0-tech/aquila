## What is Aquila?

Aquila is a service running inside the execution block. It acts as the gateway to external services. Any request that needs to enter or exit the execution environment is routed through Aquila.

Aquila keeps internal workflows updated so the execution service knows whatâ€™s happening. It communicates with actions to receive their configurations, structures, and much more.
